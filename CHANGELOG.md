# Changelog — prompt-injection-detection-prototype

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Versioning convention

Three named tags map to phase gates:

- **`v0.0.0`** — public-seed tag (immediately after the public push)
- **`v0.1.0`** — Phase 0 complete (all 50 `[OPEN]` decisions resolved + ADRs drafted + SPEC_SHEET filled + assumptions.md populated + invariant test stubs exist per Phase 0 close criterion)
- Patch versions (`v0.1.1`, `v0.1.2`, ...) — substantial work-units during Phase 1+
- **`v1.0.0`** — submission ready (PDF bundled, all WRITEUP `[TBD]` resolved, SUBMISSION_AUDIT clean)

Each release entry links closed audit findings (`SUBMISSION_AUDIT.md`) and closing ADRs.

## [0.0.0] — 2026-05-15

### Added

- Initial public seed: SDD spec-sheet kit + literature dossier + Phase 0 infrastructure
- Kit-level discipline encoded directly in `SPEC_GREENFIELD.md` spec text + decision ledger
- Constitution split into 3 files: `docs/MISSION.md`, `docs/TECH_STACK.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- 50-row decision ledger in `SPEC_GREENFIELD.md` with reference-anchors column
- Three load-bearing libraries declared: `eval-toolkit`, `runpod-deploy`, `research_toolkit`
- Anti-hand-rolling rule + upstream-issue triage protocol locked in `docs/TECH_STACK.md`
- Tests-as-invariants stubs at `tests/test_invariants.py` (7 skip-marked)
- CI scaffolding (`Makefile`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`) with hard / soft / opt-in gate split
- Phase 0 infrastructure: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `/save-transcript` skill, `decisions/ADR_TEMPLATE.md`
- Literature dossier (16 verified files) under `docs/research/` with `MANIFEST.json` (produced via `research_toolkit` pipeline)
- `scripts/regenerate_audit.py` for ADR-as-source-of-truth audit register
- `SPEC_STRATEGY.md` (classification meta-doc), `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`, `docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md`, `docs/HYPERPARAMETER_DISCLOSURE.md`, `docs/GLOSSARY.md` (living)
- `docs/MANIFEST_SCHEMA.md` (eval-output schema)
- Cover-letter two-version split: `SUBMISSION_TEMPLATE.md` (committed) + `SUBMISSION.md` (gitignored, emailed separately)
- Transcripts private by default (`transcripts/*.md` gitignored; emailed separately at submission time)
- `uv.lock` committed for byte-reproducible installs
- Notebook scaffolding (jupytext + nbstripout); notebooks themselves are Phase 2+ work

### Decisions

- Phase 0 not yet started; `SPEC_GREENFIELD.md` ledger has 50 `[OPEN]` rows pending
- See `SPEC_STRATEGY.md` for the classification + alternatives-rejected rationale
- v0.0.0 is the public seed; v0.1.0 lands when Phase 0 closes
